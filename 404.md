# Cumcord plugins

This repo contains my [Cumcord](https://github.com/Cumcord/Cumcord/) plugins.

***Please Note:** Installing via Condom is strongly recommended for multiple reasons:*
  - you don't have to trust me: the plugin is mirrored at the official repo, so it's impossible for me to push malicious code if I (for some reason?) wanted to
  - the Cum Zone has the Condom repo loaded by default, so any plugin that is on Condom but installed by other means will not show as installed in cumzone.

## The Cum Zone
The Cum Zone is a plugin store accessed from inside your client, in a similar vein to the equivalent feature in [Impregnate](https://github.com/Cumcord/Impregnate).
