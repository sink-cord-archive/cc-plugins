    |*| This is literally a React bug.
    |*| The component rerenders correctly and returns correct elements
    |*| but effects just dont run because haha its not like those are meant to run on every rerender
    |*| pushing to the dom is an effect.
    |*| your guess for why effects are brokey is as good as mine.
    |*| This is the only viable workaround. 
    |*| Hopefully when discord updates from react 17.0.2 to react 18 thisll be fixed?
